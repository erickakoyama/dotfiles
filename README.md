# Kien's Dotfiles

This is the dotfiles for my laptop.  I'm currently running antergos with i3-gaps as a window manager.

All configs are stored in dotfiles and symlinked.

# Notes
The i3 that I'm using is actually i3-gaps.  i3-gaps is a modfiied version of i3 with added features, like the addition of gaps between windows.  i3-gaps was written by [Airblader](https://github.com/Airblader/i3).  Some of the configurations in the config file **WILL NOT** work with the vanilla i3 versions.

Py3lock is a python script, that was also written by [Airblader](https://gist.github.com/Airblader/3a96a407e16dae155744), that obscures only actual windows for i3lock.
